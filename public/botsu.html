    This is my fovourate song called “asking for too much" in English. As we are living, we will ask to have shalter, and
better life. People always forget satisfaction is temportary and we always forget to appricate our surrounding materials we currently have.
    I am a materialistic person who always believe possessions and objects are the most important things in my life. Unwilling
    loss anythings I possess within my life. This song states that the change and [] should not affect on how you feel. Happiness
    with a price tag is not the realistic because happiness is priceless. Memories, places, and feeling are the most beauriful things in life.
    They are not last forever. Your classmates sit next to, or your friends hang out, even your family cannot promise and commit
    the relationship will last forever, that's why always cherish the people surrounding for this moment. Always strive to have the best moment
    with your surrounding.

    tell me about the
    Of course we need to strive to improve ourself.
    As we are living in this internet generation,
appricate
life goes fast
always forget
ppl / surrounding / trasish
this moment is the best time

    <p><small><font color="white">At the lower edge of the curtain is the grain wood floor
On a night with midwinter’s penetrating cold
I want to read my favorite novel in my bed
The time that I spend peacefully
heals my heart
In the middle of the daily franticness
I grew to like being alone

Why can nobody live
with just this happiness in front of them?
Isn’t it enough?
I don’t want to ask for too much

When I get sleepy in this state
Before I know it, with the lights of my room left on
I head into my dreams
It’d be good if I can have the freedom to doze off

Why can nobody live
with just this happiness in front of them?
Isn’t it enough?
I don’t want to ask for too much

There isn’t a single thing
That I would like to part with
If everything is all that I have now, that’s fine

Yes, even when I open my eyes, this way is best </p> </font>

    "Live to the point of tears" Albert Camus

    throughout our life, we are chasing our dreams and our desire. As the result do not meet our hope,
    we will get depression or upset. Always keep in mind that the reason of my sadness is we do try our best
    to attempt our best situation. I always believe that emotional feelings always difficult to forget.
    We always live without the sufficient of meaning. Human do get confusion and sadness sometimes, but never forget
    the meaning of tears. Tears give us an oppotunity to identify the meaning of time. What are we really looking at?
    Am I crying for someone? I believe that human are emotional animal, we do cry, langh, and sad.
